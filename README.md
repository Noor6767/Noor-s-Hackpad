## Notes: 
Hey, so this is my first ever project working with Hack Club. I built a small 6-key keyboard using the guide from Hack Club. It only has the W, A, S, D, Q, and E keys, so basically everything I need for movement and abilities in most games I play. The guide walked me through the whole process, although some of it was quite confusing, but after reading it over a couple more times, I eventually got it. I also found the 3D printing (I used Fusion 360) part confusing as well, as I bet they probably didn’t make it for a 13-year-old kid to understand. I picked these specific keys because they’re what I use the most in games. Overall, it was a fun project that taught me a lot about how keyboards actually work. Plus, it feels cool to use something I made myself every time I game. Definitely recommend having someone there to help when doing it.
