## Notes: 
Hey, so this is my first ever project working with Hack Club. I made this because sometimes you know how u just get an erdge to play a video game? well i do, but what if u dont have ur keyboard. so i made this tiny, on the go keyboard. what i found hard, was following the guide. Some parts of the guide were quite confusing but after reading it over some time more, i eventually got it. after, i found the 3-D printing part
